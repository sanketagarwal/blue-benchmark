Price is ~1.2% above the reference low. Volume bars show moderate activity. The recent structure shows multiple attempts near lows but consolidation overhead suggests intraday support may be tested but not broken decisively in next 15m.\\nAssessment: High volatility on 5m makes this difficult. Price is well above reference low, recent lows haven't been retested convincingly, and consolidation suggests equilibrium. Small chance of new low.\\n**Prediction: noNewLow = true, confidence = 0.65** (volatility discount; short timeframe noise)\\n\\n**1h (15-min candles, 8-hour lookback):**\\nReference low: 85,420.01 (28 candles back ≈ 7 hours ago)\\nCurrent price: ~86,610\\nChart shows: Clear downtrend into the reference low, followed by recovery to current levels. RSI divergences visible (marked by triangles). Moving averages still trending down but price holding above the low. Recent bounce shows some conviction; volume bars are mixed but show decent participation on upside.\\nAssessment: Price has recovered ~1,200 points from the reference low. The bounce structure shows buyers engaged. However, 1h horizon allows for one more leg down if momentum breaks. The divergences suggest weakness but recent consolidation shows some support interest.\\n**Prediction: noNewLow = true, confidence = 0.68** (recovery already in place; would need significant new selling)\\n\\n**4h (1-hour candles, 1.33-day lookback):**\\nReference low: 85,296.835 (9 candles back ≈ 9 hours ago)\\nCurrent price: ~86,364\\nChart shows: Strong downtrend into reference low, followed by recovery. The chart shows marked support area around 85,300. Multiple attempts near the low showed bounces. Bollinger Bands show compression into the low then expansion upward. Volume profile suggests accumulation near lows.\\nAssessment: This is closer to a structural bottom formation. The 4h shows the clearest double-bottom pattern attempt, with buyers stepping in near support. Moving averages still downward-sloping but price well-supported. Time frame (4h) allows for pattern consolidation rather than quick reversals.\\n**Prediction: noNewLow = true, confidence = 0.71** (pattern forming near support; multiple bounces suggest buyer exhaustion of sellers)\\n\\n**24h (4-hour candles, 8-day lookback):**\\nReference low: 85,296.835 (6 candles back ≈ 24 hours ago)\\nCurrent price: ~88,391\\nChart shows: Longer-term perspective shows volatility but the 85,300 level has been tested and defended. Recent candles show strength (large green candle 6 bars back, consolidation with upside bias). Volume bars at bottom show elevated activity near lows, consistent with capitulation and support accumulation. Chart structure shows higher low formation attempt.\\nAssessment: 24h timeframe shows clearest bottom structure. The reference low was hit ~24 hours ago and strong recovery followed. Price is now ~3% above the low. Chart shows no imminent breakdown risk; consolidation shows support resilience.

The structure shows a potential higher low forming, but there's still downside pressure with price below MAs. Moderately high confidence the low holds.\\n\\n4h: The hourly chart shows price bounced from the 85,296 low about 9 hours ago and has been consolidating. Recent price action shows a failed attempt to break higher (89K rejection) followed by selling. While the bounce looks constructive, the 4-hour window increases risk of retesting lows.\\n\\n24h: The 4h chart shows significant volatility with a sharp rejection from 89K+. Over a 24-hour period, there's meaningful risk of retesting the 85,296 low, especially given the bearish engulfing pattern visible on higher timeframes and the overall downtrend context from recent highs. Slight lean toward new low being made.\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.85},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.75},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.7},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":false,\"confidence\":0.55}}}",

Chart shows price consolidating in the 86,000-87,000 range after recent decline. The lower Bollinger Band and support structure suggest the 15m bounce is holding. Limited downside catalyst visible in next 15 minutes. Probability of holding the low is high given current price positioning and recent support.\\n\\n**1h (15-minute candles)**: Reference low 85,420.01 is 26 candles back (~6.5 hours). Price has recovered from that low and is consolidating around 86,400-87,000. Chart shows Bollinger Bands widening with price in upper half. Recent structure suggests support is holding. Next hour unlikely to break lower given current momentum and support levels identified.\\n\\n**4h (1-hour candles)**: Reference low 85,296.835 is 9 candles back (~9 hours ago). Price currently around 86,364. The chart shows recent recovery from that low with consolidation pattern forming. Lower Bollinger Band suggests downside cushion, but price action shows potential support holding. However, with 4 hours of trading and if momentum turns, there's moderate risk. The consolidation pattern is fragile.\\n\\n**24h (4-hour candles)**: Reference low 85,296.835 is 6 candles back (~24 hours ago). Current price 88,391 shows significant recovery from the low. Over a 24-hour horizon, the market has shown resilience from that level. Bollinger Bands suggest upside bias currently. With a full day of trading ahead and price well above the reference low with established support, the probability of holding is high, though 24h provides sufficient time for reversal risk.\\n\\nConfidence levels reflect the increased uncertainty and volatility risk window as timeframes extend.\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.82},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.78},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.72},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.68}}}",

The recent bullish engulfing candle and upward rejection from the EMA(20) suggest a short-term bottoming structure. The Bollinger Bands are contracting, indicating reduced volatility and a potential breakout soon.\\n\\n2. **1h Timeframe:** The price has shown a clear rejection at the 85,420.01 level, with multiple lower lows being avoided. The recent upward movement and the alignment of the price above the EMA(20) and the upper Bollinger Band indicate a bullish momentum. The volume profile shows increased buying interest, reinforcing the likelihood of a breakout.\\n\\n3. **4h Timeframe:** The price has recently rejected the 85,296.835 low, forming a higher low. The recent upward candle and the rejection at the lower Bollinger Band suggest a potential reversal. The volume spike on the recent bullish candle adds confidence to the bullish outlook.\\n\\n4. **24h Timeframe:** The broader structure shows a significant rejection at the 85,296.835 low, with the price forming a higher low. The recent upward movement and the alignment of the price above the EMA(20) on the 4-hour chart suggest a bullish trend resuming. The overall volume distribution supports the bullish momentum.\\n\\n**Summary:** Across all timeframes, there is a consistent rejection of the reference lows, supported by technical indicators and volume patterns. This suggests a high probability of the price not making new lows within the prediction horizons.\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.95},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.92},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.88},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.85}}}",

Short-term momentum appears to be stabilizing after the selloff. Moderate confidence the low holds for 15 minutes.\\n\\n1h: The 15m chart shows a sharp selloff from ~89,000 to current levels around 85,594. Price is below all moving averages (SMA, EMA, VWAP) indicating bearish pressure. However, the reference low at 85,316 has held through recent selling. Some stabilization visible but downtrend intact.\\n\\n4h: The 1h chart shows significant volatility with a recent rejection from 89,000+ levels. Current price action shows weakness but the 85,296 reference low (8 candles back) has held. The broader structure shows support around 85,000-85,300 zone. Moderate uncertainty as selling pressure remains.\\n\\n24h: The 4h chart shows a strong rally to ~89,500 followed by rejection. Over a 24-hour horizon, given the overall bearish structure on shorter timeframes and the rejection from highs, there's elevated risk of revisiting and potentially breaking below the 85,296 reference low.

For the longer timeframes (4h and 24h), we see a more constructive pattern forming with price recently bouncing from the reference low area (85296.835) and showing early signs of accumulation with higher volume on green candles. The 4h chart shows a potential double bottom formation, suggesting the low might hold, though with moderate confidence.
