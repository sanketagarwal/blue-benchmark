    "modelOutputRaw": "{\"reasoning\":\"**15m Analysis:** Price at 88,161 is trading well above the reference low of 88,062 (only ~100 points buffer). The 5m chart shows consolidation around VWAP (88,194) with price finding support at the lower Bollinger Band. Recent candles show stabilization after a pullback from 88,300. Short-term momentum appears neutral to slightly bullish. The reference low is very close (5 candles back) but holding. Moderate-high confidence it holds for 15 minutes.\\n\\n**1h Analysis:** Same reference low (88,062) with more time exposure. The 15m chart shows a broader downtrend from the 88,500 high but price has found support around 88,100-88,200 multiple times. Price is currently testing the middle of the recent range. The consolidation pattern and multiple tests of support without breaking suggest the low should hold, though extended exposure time reduces confidence.\\n\\n**4h Analysis:** Reference low is 86,605 from just 1 candle back - a very recent and significant low. The 1h chart shows a strong recovery from this level with price now at 88,226 (+1,600 points above). However, 4 hours is significant time and price is showing some topping patterns (red candles at recent highs ~88,700-89,000). The recovery looks impulsive and may need to retest. Given the sharp move up and bearish divergence potential, there's moderate risk of retesting toward that low. Lower confidence this holds.\\n\\n**24h Analysis:** Reference low is 84,432 from 13 candles (52 hours) back. The 4h chart shows a clear higher low pattern forming (84,432 → 86,605 → current consolidation). Price has established support above previous lows. The structural pattern suggests accumulation. While 24 hours allows significant movement, breaking below 84,432 would require a major trend reversal.

The price has shown some resilience but also some bearish pressure, indicating a potential test of the low.\\n\\n- **4h Horizon**: The 1-hour chart indicates a recent low at 86605, which is lower than the reference low. However, there's a slight recovery, suggesting a possible stabilization or bounce.\\n\\n- **24h Horizon**: The 4-hour chart shows a broader perspective where the price has already undercut the reference low of 84432.2.

Chart shows recent divergence pattern with lower high marked (red triangle at ~11:50). Price oscillating between Bollinger Bands (blue lines) with SMA(20)=88,196 and EMA(20)=88,196 acting as dynamic resistance. Volume bars show mixed momentum. Within 15m, only 3 candles needed to test reference low—strong Bollinger Band squeeze suggests mean reversion likely, but recent upside break and proximity to SMAs indicate slight bullish bias. Probability of new low: ~45%.\\n\\n**1h (15-min candles, ref low 88,062.545 = 24 bars back):**\\nPrice oscillating in tight range (88,100–88,300). Four local extrema marked; most recent lower high (~13:00) suggests exhaustion of upside. SMA(20)=88,206 and EMA(20)=88,201 both flat-to-slightly-rising. Bollinger Bands wide (87,900–88,500 implied). Volume histogram shows declining momentum last 4–6 bars (red dominance). Over 1h (4 fifteen-minute candles), support at 88,062 is ~140 pips away. Current momentum is neutral-to-downside; RSI and MACD both showing signs of stalling. Probability of new low: ~50%.\\n\\n**4h (1-hour candles, ref low 86,605 = 0 bars back = current bar):**\\nCritical: Reference low IS the most recent swing low (blue triangle marker visible). Price recovered into 88,000–88,200 range but remains below prior highs (89,000 zone). SMA(20)=88,077 and EMA(20)=88,060 both below current price. Bollinger Band lower bound ~84,000, upper ~89,000. Four local extrema marked. Price rejection off 89,000 multiple times suggests strong resistance. Over 4h horizon, price needs to drop ~1,400 pips below 86,605 to make new low. Volume declining. Current setup: mean-reverting from extremes, not extending downside.

For the 24h chart, despite recent volatility, the price bounced well off the reference low and is consolidating above it; there is probable support preventing new lows within the next 24 hours but with slightly less confidence than the shorter horizons due to longer timeframe variability.\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.85},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.8},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.85},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.75}}}",

This suggests a short-term bullish bias with a high likelihood of holding the recent low (~87,935) in the next 15 minutes. Confidence is high due to clear technical confirmation and volume spike on the recent bullish candle.\\n\\n**1h Analysis:** The 15-minute chart (1h horizon) shows a consolidation phase with price hovering around the 20-period EMA and SMA. Bollinger Bands are slightly widening, indicating some volatility, but the price has not yet broken below the recent low (~87,935). The recent bullish candle on the 5m chart aligns with a potential breakout on the 1h chart. However, the presence of red arrows (potential resistance levels) and the lack of a strong upward momentum beyond the recent highs suggests caution. Confidence is moderate due to the proximity of resistance levels and the need for a clear breakout.\\n\\n**4h Analysis:** The 1-hour chart (4h horizon) shows a more extended consolidation with price oscillating around the 20-period EMA (~87,455). The recent low (~86,605) is the immediate focus, and the price is currently above this level. The Bollinger Bands are expanding slightly, indicating some volatility, but the price action does not show a clear downward momentum. The recent bullish candle on the 1h chart and the alignment with the 20-period EMA suggest a potential for holding the low, but the presence of red arrows (potential resistance) and the need for a sustained breakout above recent highs adds uncertainty. Confidence is moderate to high due to the current position above the reference low and the alignment with moving averages.\\n\\n**24h Analysis:** The 4-hour chart (24h horizon) shows a broader perspective with price consolidating around the 20-period EMA (~87,240) and recent low (~84,432). The price is currently well above this reference low, and the Bollinger Bands are expanding, indicating increased volatility.

Confidence is moderate due to the broader market context and the need for sustained bullish momentum.\\n\\n**Summary:** Across all timeframes, the price is currently positioned above the reference lows, with varying degrees of bullish momentum and technical confirmation. The highest confidence is in the short-term (15m) due to clear bullish reversal patterns, while the longer-term (24h) confidence is slightly lower due to broader market considerations.\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.95},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.75},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.85},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.7}}}",

Volume is increasing on recent bullish candles, suggesting short-covering or accumulation. The recent low at 87934.995 was not breached, and the price is currently hovering above it with upward momentum. This indicates a potential bottom formation in the short term.\\n\\n**1h Analysis:** The 15-minute chart shows a clear upward trend with price consolidating above the 20-period EMA (~88074) and the reference low of 87934.995.

The 15-minute window is short and current structure suggests the low should hold.\\n\\n1h: The 15m chart shows a clear downtrend from earlier highs (~88,450) but has found support around 87,935-88,000 multiple times. Price is currently recovering and trading above the reference low with about 130 points of buffer. Bollinger bands are relatively tight suggesting consolidation rather than continuation.\\n\\n4h: The hourly chart shows a strong recovery from the 86,782 low with price now above all major MAs. The structure shows higher lows being formed after the sharp drop on 12/19. Current price ~88,200 provides a ~1,400 point cushion above the reference low. However, volatility remains elevated.\\n\\n24h: The 4h chart shows significant volatility with a major low at 84,432 about 13 candles back. Price has recovered substantially to 88,226, well above both the 20 SMA (87,240) and EMA (87,455).

Price has been trading sideways with increasing support from EMAs and now seems to be starting an uptrend. The higher timeframe momentum appears to be shifting positive.\\n\\nFor the 24-hour horizon (4-hour candles), we can see that BTC has already bounced significantly from the major low at 84432.2 and has established a series of higher lows on the daily timeframe. The overall structure shows improving bullish momentum with price now stabilizing above 88000, suggesting the major low will hold for the next 24 hours.\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":false,\"confidence\":0.65},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":false,\"confidence\":0.6},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.7},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.75}}}",

The price is currently consolidating above the reference low (87934.995) with bullish engulfing patterns and volume confirmation. The EMA(20) is rising, and the price is above both the SMA(20) and EMA(20), indicating short-term bullish momentum. The recent downtrend has been rejected, and the volume profile shows increased buying interest at lower levels, suggesting a potential bottom formation. The Bollinger Bands are narrowing, which often precedes a breakout. This setup strongly suggests a high probability of holding the reference low in the next 15 minutes.\\n\\n**1h Analysis:** The 15-minute chart shows a clear rejection of the downtrend with a bullish divergence in the RSI and a strong volume spike at the recent low. The price is consolidating above the reference low (87934.995) and the EMA(20) is trending upwards. The Bollinger Bands are also expanding upwards, indicating potential upward momentum. The recent downtrend line has been broken upwards, and the price action is showing signs of bullish exhaustion. These factors suggest a high probability of the reference low holding in the next hour.\\n\\n**4h Analysis:** The 1-hour chart shows a significant bullish reversal from a long-term downtrend. The price has formed a higher low above the reference low (86782.285) and is currently consolidating above the EMA(20). The Bollinger Bands are expanding, and the price is above the key moving averages, indicating bullish momentum. The volume profile shows increased buying interest, and the recent rejection of the downtrend line suggests a potential structural bottom. The probability of the reference low holding in the next 4 hours is high, though slightly less certain than the shorter timeframes due to the larger horizon.\\n\\n**24h Analysis:** The 4-hour chart shows a longer-term consolidation above the reference low (84432.2). Although the price has been volatile, it has not yet undercut the reference low significantly. The EMA(20) is flat to slightly upward sloping, and the Bollinger Bands are expanding, indicating potential volatility. The price action shows signs of bullish exhaustion and a possible accumulation phase. However, the longer timeframe introduces more uncertainty due to macroeconomic factors and potential external influences. The confidence is moderate due to the extended prediction horizon and the presence of mixed signals in the volume profile.\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.95},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.92},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.85},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.75}}}",

Volume is increasing on the upside, and the price is forming higher lows relative to the recent downtrend. The recent candle structure (e.g., the long red candle followed by a long green candle) suggests a potential exhaustion of sellers and a short-term bottom formation. The Bollinger Bands are contracting, which often precedes a breakout, and the price is near the lower band, indicating a potential bounce. The volume profile also shows a shift towards positive volume, reinforcing the bullish bias. This suggests a high likelihood of holding the reference low in the next 15 minutes with high confidence.\\n\\n**1h Analysis:** The 15m chart shows a similar bullish reversal pattern with price consolidating above the EMA(20) and BB lower band. The recent downward momentum appears to be stalling, and the price is forming a higher low around the reference low (~87935). The volume profile shows a mix of positive and negative volume, but the recent candles are closing higher, indicating a potential accumulation phase. The Bollinger Bands are also converging, which often signals a potential breakout.

Volume is increasing on the upside, and the price is forming higher lows relative to the recent downtrend. The recent candle structure (e.g., the long red candle followed by a long green candle) suggests a potential exhaustion of sellers and a short-term bottom formation. The Bollinger Bands are contracting, which often precedes a breakout, and the price is near the lower band, indicating a potential bounce. The volume profile also shows a shift towards positive volume, reinforcing the bullish bias. This suggests a high likelihood of holding the reference low in the next 15 minutes with high confidence.\\n\\n**1h Analysis:** The 15m chart shows a similar bullish reversal pattern with price consolidating above the EMA(20) and BB lower band. The recent downward momentum appears to be stalling, and the price is forming a higher low around the reference low (~87935). The volume profile shows a mix of positive and negative volume, but the recent candles are closing higher, indicating a potential accumulation phase. The Bollinger Bands are also converging, which often signals a potential breakout. The price action is showing signs of exhaustion, and the recent red arrows (downward pressure) are being rejected at the EMA(20). This suggests a moderate to high confidence that the reference low will hold within the next hour.\\n\\n**4h Analysis:** The 1h chart shows a more extended consolidation phase with price hovering around the EMA(20) and BB lower band. The recent downward pressure (red arrows) seems to be losing steam, and the price is forming a higher low around the reference low (~86782). The Bollinger Bands are converging, and the price is near the lower band, indicating potential for a bounce. The volume profile shows a significant drop in negative volume, suggesting reduced selling pressure. Although the trend is still slightly bearish, the recent price action and indicators suggest a potential reversal. This scenario warrants a cautious optimism with moderate confidence that the reference low will hold within the next 4 hours.\\n\\n**24h Analysis:** The 4h chart shows a broader perspective with price consolidating around the EMA(20) and BB lower band. The recent downward pressure (red arrows) appears to be weakening, and the price is forming a higher low around the reference low (~84432). The Bollinger Bands are converging, and the price is near the lower band, which often precedes a breakout. The volume profile shows a mix of positive and negative volume, but the recent candles are indicating a potential accumulation phase. The overall trend remains slightly bearish, but the recent price action and indicators suggest a possible bottom formation. This scenario requires a higher degree of caution, but there is a moderate confidence that the reference low will hold within the next 24 hours.\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.95},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.85},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.75},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.7}}}",

The chart displays a significant uptrend from that low, with multiple higher lows and higher highs establishing a bullish structure. Price has moved from the 84,000 level to near 89,000. The SMAs are trending upward. To create a new low would require a reversal of the entire recent uptrend and breaking multiple support levels. Confidence: 0.78\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- Shorter timeframes (15m-1h) have more immediate risk given price proximity and recent chop\\n- Longer timeframes (4h-24h) have strong bullish structure and greater distance from reference lows\\n- Overall conviction increases with longer prediction horizons\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.6},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.65},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.72},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.78}}}",
