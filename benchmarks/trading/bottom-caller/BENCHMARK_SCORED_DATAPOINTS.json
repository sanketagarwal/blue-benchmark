Shorter timeframes show no decisive reversal (no bullish engulfing, no capitulation, volume is mixed, and price is not springing off lows). On 15m and 1h, price is hugging the lower Bollinger Band after a strong selloff, with no notable upside bounce; in fact, the trend is weak, suggesting further tests of the low are possible. On the 4h and 24h charts the most recent candle undercut the range and closed weak, with high sell-side volume. Crucially, on the 24h chart, the most recent reference low (84432.2) is from the latest candle, and with a fresh breakdown there is a strong risk for further downside. There is no clear reversal structure (no double bottom, no spring, no hammer, no bullish engulfing candle, and MAs are turning down).

Extended decline appears likely within 4 hours given the broken support structure. 24h: Over the 24-hour period, Bitcoin shows an established downtrend from ~91,000 highs with the most recent 4-hour candle very bearish. The reference low of 84,432.2 (1 candle back) represents a very recent low that may be tested or broken. However, with extended timeframe volatility and potential for stabilization, there's moderate confidence it gets broken, but the trend clearly points downward.\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.72},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":false,\"confidence\":0.68},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":false,\"confidence\":0.73},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":false,\"confidence\":0.65}}}",

Current price action (87,186) is weakening with momentum building downward.

The price is above the key moving averages, reinforcing the prediction of holding the low.\\n\\n**24h Analysis:** The 4-hour chart shows a more extended consolidation period with price forming higher lows above the 84,432.2 reference low. The EMA(20) is slightly upward sloping, and the Bollinger Bands are relatively stable. The recent bullish candles and volume spikes indicate a possible accumulation phase. The price is above the key moving averages and shows signs of bullish momentum, which supports the prediction of holding the low despite the broader market context.\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.9},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.95},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.85},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.8}}}",

Chart shows consolidation above the reference low with price holding in the upper band. Recent local extrema marked by green triangles show support structure. EMA (orange) is above SMA (blue), showing minor uptrend. Over 15 minutes, the tight consolidation pattern and proximity to moving averages suggest the reference low will likely hold. Confidence 0.72 - moderate conviction due to short timeframe and potential for quick moves.\\n\\n**1h (ref: 86569.53)**: Current price ~87277. This is a larger drop needed (-710). The 15m chart shows a strong bearish structure with price declining from ~89500. The reference low was 15 candles back in the 1h chart, and price action shows we're in a downtrend with multiple local lows marked. Current price is above but bearish structure suggests penetration likely. Confidence 0.68.\\n\\n**4h (ref: 86569.53)**: Current price ~87160. Reference low was 28 candles back. The 1h chart shows significant downside momentum with price declining from ~89000 toward 87000. The Bollinger Bands show widening volatility and price near the lower band. The downtrend structure and the fact that price has been declining steadily suggests a new low is probable. Confidence 0.70.\\n\\n**24h (ref: 84432.2)**: Current price ~87406. This requires a significant drop (-2974). The 4h chart shows price has been in consolidation above support after rallying from earlier lows. However, the reference low at 84432.2 was just 1 candle back (recent), suggesting it was tested recently. The 4h chart structure shows we're below the SMA and declining, with Bollinger Bands widening. The recent test combined with bearish momentum over 24h makes a new low probable.
