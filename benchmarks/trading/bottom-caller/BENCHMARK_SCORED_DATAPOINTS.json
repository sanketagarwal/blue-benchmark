The 15m chart shows recent consolidation around 86,000-86,600 after a decline. Price is currently attempting recovery but remains below recent highs. The next 15 minutes show mixed signals - recent candles show some buying but momentum is not strong. The reference low sits ~1.4% below current price. Given the recent price action shows probing downward and limited bullish confirmation, there's meaningful risk of the reference low being tested and broken. Confidence is moderate due to short timeframe volatility.\\n\\n**1h (15-min candles):** Current price ~86,610 vs reference low 85,420.01. The 1h chart shows a clear downtrend from earlier highs (~89,000) with consolidation forming in the 86,000-87,000 range. The reference low is from 28 candles back (7 hours) representing a previous support zone that has been tested multiple times. Price action shows some reversal attempts but with weak conviction. The EMA(20) at 87,289 is above current price suggesting downside pressure. Over the next hour, with consolidation patterns and lack of strong buy signals, the reference low remains at risk. Moderate confidence that it will be broken.\\n\\n**4h (1-hour candles):** Current price ~86,364 vs reference low 85,296.835 (9 candles/9 hours back). The 4h chart shows a significant downtrend with the reference low being an established support level. Price is currently consolidating above this level but with weak structure. The recent candle action shows lower lows forming on the right side of the chart. The volume profile and price action suggest exhaustion of the current bounce attempt. The reference low represents a critical support that's being approached. Over 4 hours, probability is high that this level will be tested and potentially broken given the trend structure. Higher conviction of a new low.\\n\\n**24h (4-hour candles):** Current price ~88,391 vs reference low 85,296.835 (6 candles/24 hours back). The 24h chart shows a dramatic decline from ~90,000+ levels down to the reference low zone, with the most recent candle showing a large bullish reversal (green/teal candle). This suggests strong support confirmation at the reference low level. The reversal candle with significant volume suggests institutional buying at this level. Over the next 24 hours, the reference low appears to have established strong structural support. The probability of holding above this support level is high given the bounce confirmation.

Here are my observations and predictions:\\n\\n- **15m Horizon**: The 5-minute chart shows a recent uptrend after a dip, with the price currently above the reference low. The momentum seems positive, suggesting a potential hold of the low.\\n\\n- **1h Horizon**: The 15-minute chart indicates a similar trend with a recovery from a recent low. The price is above the reference low, and the trend suggests it might hold.\\n\\n- **4h Horizon**: The 1-hour chart shows a consolidation pattern after a decline, with the price slightly above the reference low. The trend is less clear, but the consolidation might indicate a hold.\\n\\n- **24h Horizon**: The 4-hour chart shows a longer-term downtrend with recent stabilization. The price is close to the reference low, suggesting a higher risk of undercutting.\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.85},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.75},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.65},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":false,\"confidence\":0.6}}}",

The moving averages are still bearish but the price is testing the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting a possible oversold condition.\\n\\n- **24h**: The long-term trend is bearish, but there are signs of a potential reversal with the recent price action showing a bounce from a significant support level.

Confidence: 0.68 (strong trend, but slightly more time to recover).\\n\\n**4h (1-hour candles):** Extended lookback shows a major sell-off starting around 17:00 with a large red candle. Price is approaching the reference low marked by the green triangle around 17:00. The recent large red candle (18:00-19:00 area visible in structure) breaks below midline support. Bollinger Bands are widening on the downside. Within 4 hours, given the aggressive downtrend and breakdown structure, a new low is probable. Confidence: 0.65 (structural breakdown evident).\\n\\n**24h (4-hour candles):** The most recent candle is a massive red close breaking below key support levels. Looking at the 8-day structure, this represents a significant capitulation move. The green triangle marks support that was broken. With ongoing selling pressure and a 24-hour horizon allowing for continuation of this downtrend, the reference low is likely to be tested and breached. Confidence: 0.62 (longest timeframe introduces more uncertainty, but trend is clearly bearish).\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":false,\"confidence\":0.72},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":false,\"confidence\":0.68},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":false,\"confidence\":0.65},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":false,\"confidence\":0.62}}}",

Chart shows volatile upward momentum with recent strength. Moving averages (SMA/EMA) are above the low. Bollinger Band lower bound well below current price suggests near-term floor. High probability the 15-min horizon will not break the low. Confidence: 0.75\\n\\n**1h (15-min candles)**: Similar to 15m - price trading 500+ points above reference low with bullish momentum structure. While there's been volatility, the 8-hour lookback shows the low at extreme left of chart with multiple bars between current price and that level. Confidence: 0.70\\n\\n**4h (1-hour candles)**: This is the critical level - the reference low (84432.2) is exactly at the 32-candle lookback boundary. Recent price action shows a severe 4-hour candle closing near 84,450, and the chart displays two major bearish red candles (16:00 and 18:00 bars). Current consolidation shows weakness below 87,000. The downtrend is intact, and within a 4-hour horizon, a test/break of this support is plausible. Confidence: 0.72\\n\\n**24h (4-hour candles)**: The 13-candle lookback reveals the low is 5 bars back. The recent severe sell-off with a massive red candle (18:00 bar) closing near 84,450 suggests structural weakness. For a 24-hour horizon with current downward momentum and proximity to this critical level already tested, probability of a new low below 84432.2 increases significantly.
