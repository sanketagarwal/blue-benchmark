However, the short-term volatility and the recent drop suggest some uncertainty.\\n\\n- **1h Horizon**: The 15-minute chart indicates a more significant drop but also shows signs of a potential reversal with the recent green candles. The support level seems to be holding, but the confidence is moderate due to the recent sharp decline.\\n\\n- **4h Horizon**: The 1-hour chart shows a clear downtrend but with a recent consolidation near the reference low. The price action suggests a possible base formation, but the confidence is lower due to the extended period of consolidation.\\n\\n- **24h Horizon**: The 4-hour chart shows a longer-term perspective with a significant drop but with a recent stabilization. The price has not yet shown a strong reversal, but the longer timeframe suggests a higher probability of holding the low due to potential exhaustion of selling pressure.\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.7},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.65},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.6},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.75}}}",

The 5m chart shows a strong bounce off recent lows with a large green volume candle at 18:45-19:00. Price is reclaiming the lower Bollinger Band and showing short-term momentum. The reference low is only 5 candles back (~25 mins), giving limited time for a retest. Short-term momentum favors holding.\\n\\n**1h Analysis:** The 15m chart shows a clear downtrend from ~89,500 highs with the reference low at 85,420 established around 16:45. Current price action shows consolidation/slight bounce. Price is below all major MAs (SMA 87,361, EMA 86,956, VWAP 87,606) indicating bearish structure, but the immediate bounce off lows with volume suggests near-term support. The low being 25 candles back means significant time has passed without a retest.\\n\\n**4h Analysis:** The 1h chart shows the 85,296 low was established 8 hours ago with price recovering to ~87,000+ area before recent pullback. Structure is choppy with clear resistance at 88,500-89,000. Price currently testing the lower range. The pattern shows higher lows forming after the reference low, but bearish pressure remains with price below VWAP.\\n\\n**24h Analysis:** The 4h chart reveals a more volatile structure with the 85,296 low being tested after a strong rally to ~89,500. Over 24 hours, there's significant risk of retesting or breaking this low given: 1) Price rejected sharply from 89,500 area (marked with red triangle), 2) Current price at ~88,391 but showing distribution pattern, 3) Longer timeframe allows more opportunity for volatility.

Lower confidence due to longer timeframes having more uncertainty.\\n\\nKey observations:\\n- Candles are showing shorter wicks\\n- Volume seems to be decreasing on downward moves\\n- Moving averages are flattening\\n- Price is holding above key reference lows\\n\\nWhile not guaranteed, the technical structure suggests the reference lows are likely to hold across all analyzed timeframes.\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.75},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.7},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.65},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.6}}}",

Overall: very high risk of a new low short-term, moderate risk 4h, lower risk over 24h.\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":false,\"confidence\":0.9},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":false,\"confidence\":0.85},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":false,\"confidence\":0.6},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.7}}}",

The 1h chart reveals a sharp selloff from ~89,000 with the most recent candle showing significant selling pressure. The 4h chart shows two major selloffs with the latest bringing price to test the 84,400 area again. Short-term (15m, 1h), the proximity to the reference low with initial buying interest suggests it may hold temporarily. However, the strong downtrend across all timeframes, broken support levels, and bearish structure increases risk of a breakdown on longer horizons (4h, 24h). The 24h outlook is particularly concerning given the persistent selling pressure and lack of meaningful bounces.\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.75},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.68},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.62},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":false,\"confidence\":0.58}}}",

The recent price action shows minimal bounce strength, with the most recent candles remaining bearish and testing lower levels. Within 15 minutes, there's a high probability of testing the 84,432 low.\\n\\n**1h (15m candles)**: Broader 1h view shows strong bearish continuation below key support levels. Price has broken below 87,000 support and is declining toward lower levels. The 8-hour lookback shows a sustained downtrend with weakening bounces. Testing the reference low is likely within the next hour.\\n\\n**4h (1h candles)**: The 4-hour timeframe shows a major bearish breakdown. The most recent large red candle plunged from ~88,000 to ~84,450. Despite brief green candles, the overall trend remains firmly down.

The chart shows strong downtrend throughout the 2-hour period with price dropping from ~87000 to ~85000. Recent candles show continued weakness and downward pressure. The lower Bollinger Band sits near 84432. Price is in a clear bearish structure with lower highs and lower lows. Probability of new low within 15m is HIGH given momentum.\\n\\n**1h (15-min candles, 8h lookback):** Price currently ~85000. Chart shows sustained downtrend from ~89000 down to current levels. The reference low at 84432 is just 568 points below. Recent price action shows multiple attempts lower with red candles dominating. Lower Bollinger Band around 84000 suggests potential for break below 84432. Downtrend is clearly intact with lower lows being made.\\n\\n**4h (1h candles, 1.33d lookback):** Recently printed a strong bearish candle closing near 84450, near the reference low. The larger timeframe shows consolidation around 87000-84000 range with recent breakdown. Lower band near 84432. The 1h candle structure shows weakness, and we're already touching the reference low area. Risk of new low is present within 4h window.\\n\\n**24h (4h candles, 8d lookback):** Current price near 84450. Most recent 4h candle is heavily bearish (red, large body). The reference low of 84432 was 13 candles back (52 hours ago). Chart shows overall downtrend from 89000+ range. Current price is already just 18 points above reference low. Volume and momentum indicators show weakness. Over 24 hours, significant risk exists for new lows given strong selling pressure.\\n\\n**Cross-timeframe synthesis:** All timeframes show bearish structure. Current price (84974 on 5m, ~84450 on larger frames) is near or touching the reference low. The downtrend is clear and unbroken. Multiple timeframes show lower lows being established. The probability of new lows increases with longer timeframes due to the sustained bearish structure.\\n\\n**Key observations:**\\n- Price is already very close to reference low on larger timeframes\\n- Consistent lower lows across all timeframes\\n- Lower Bollinger Bands support downward moves\\n- Volume remains elevated on down candles\\n- No strong bullish reversal signals visible\\n\\n**Predictions:**\\n- 15m: HIGH risk of new low (noNewLow = FALSE), confidence 0.75\\n- 1h: HIGH risk of new low (noNewLow = FALSE), confidence 0.72\\n- 4h: MODERATE-HIGH risk (noNewLow = FALSE), confidence 0.68\\n- 24h: MODERATE-HIGH risk (noNewLow = FALSE), confidence 0.65\\n\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":false,\"confidence\":0.75},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":false,\"confidence\":0.72},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":false,\"confidence\":0.68},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":false,\"confidence\":0.65}}}",
