This 'V-shaped' recovery and the subsequent consolidation above 86,000 indicates strong demand at these lower levels. The reference low for the 4h and 24h horizons (~85,296) aligns with a structural support zone from the previous day, creating a 'double bottom' or 'higher low' setup on the 4h timeframe. Given the magnitude of the rejection of lower prices and the current distance (>1%) from the critical support levels, it is statistically unlikely for the price to revisit and break these lows within the shorter timeframes. Over the 24h horizon, while the local downtrend from 89k presents some risk, the prevailing range support at 85k is expected to hold.\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.95},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.85},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.75},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.65}}}",

However, the recent bullish reversal candle and the fact that price has not yet broken below the recent low of 85,316.005 (which is now slightly above the current price) suggest a potential bottoming formation. The Bollinger Bands are contracting, indicating reduced volatility and a possible consolidation phase. The volume profile shows mixed signals but no overwhelming bearish momentum. Confidence is moderate due to the mixed signals and the proximity to the EMA.\\n\\n**4h Analysis:** The 4-hour chart shows a more pronounced downward trend with a recent break below the 20-period EMA (~87,211) and a significant low at 85,296.835. However, the recent bullish candle and the fact that the price is currently above the 85,296.835 low suggest a potential short-term reversal. The Bollinger Bands are expanding slightly, indicating increased volatility. The volume profile shows a recent increase in buying pressure, which could signal a bottoming process. Confidence is moderate-high due to the recent bullish candle and volume increase.\\n\\n**24h Analysis:** The daily chart shows a broader downward trend with a recent low at 85,296.835. The price is currently consolidating above this low, and the absence of a clear breakout below this level suggests a potential structural bottom. The Bollinger Bands are relatively wide, indicating higher volatility, but the price action has not yet confirmed a decisive break below the reference low. The volume profile shows some signs of accumulation, which can be indicative of a bottom.

The lower Bollinger band is around 84,400-84,500. Given the downtrend established and price proximity to the reference low, there's meaningful risk of undercut within 15 minutes. However, the recent consolidation and minor bounces suggest some support forming. Moderate-to-high probability of new low.\\n\\n**1h Chart (15-min candles):**\\nThe 8-hour lookback shows a clear downtrend from ~89,000 to ~85,000. The reference low (84,432.2) is the absolute bottom 31 candles back (~8 hours ago). Current price is ~85,000. The moving averages (20 and EMA) are clearly declining. However, the very recent candles (last 4-6 bars) show some stabilization and minor recovery attempts above 85,000. The chart suggests momentum is decelerating slightly. Within the next hour, there's a meaningful possibility of testing the reference low again, but some recovery patterns suggest it may hold. Moderate risk.\\n\\n**4h Chart (1-hour candles):**\\nThe chart shows a significant structure with the reference low (84,432.2) occurring exactly 32 candles back (at the far left of the 1.33-day lookback). The entire period from that low shows a clear downtrend with lower highs and lower lows, culminating in recent severe weakness with a large red candle dropping to ~84,500. Current consolidation around that level. The moving averages remain bearish. Within 4 hours, the market is in extreme proximity to the reference low and has shown continued downward pressure. High probability of new low or at least testing below current levels.\\n\\n**24h Chart (4-hour candles):**\\nThe 8-day lookback shows more significant structure. The reference low (84,432.2) occurred 13 candles back (~2 days ago). Since that low, the market has recovered somewhat but recently made a devastating decline with the last candle showing a large red close near 84,500.

Current price appears to be around 85,000. The 2-hour lookback shows a series of lower lows establishing a downtrend. Recent candles show some consolidation/minor recovery attempts. The lower Bollinger band is around 84,400-84,500. Given the downtrend established and price proximity to the reference low, there's meaningful risk of undercut within 15 minutes. However, the recent consolidation and minor bounces suggest some support forming. Moderate-to-high probability of new low.\\n\\n**1h Chart (15-min candles):**\\nThe 8-hour lookback shows a clear downtrend from ~89,000 to ~85,000. The reference low (84,432.2) is the absolute bottom 31 candles back (~8 hours ago). Current price is ~85,000. The moving averages (20 and EMA) are clearly declining. However, the very recent candles (last 4-6 bars) show some stabilization and minor recovery attempts above 85,000. The chart suggests momentum is decelerating slightly. Within the next hour, there's a meaningful possibility of testing the reference low again, but some recovery patterns suggest it may hold. Moderate risk.\\n\\n**4h Chart (1-hour candles):**\\nThe chart shows a significant structure with the reference low (84,432.2) occurring exactly 32 candles back (at the far left of the 1.33-day lookback). The entire period from that low shows a clear downtrend with lower highs and lower lows, culminating in recent severe weakness with a large red candle dropping to ~84,500. Current consolidation around that level. The moving averages remain bearish. Within 4 hours, the market is in extreme proximity to the reference low and has shown continued downward pressure. High probability of new low or at least testing below current levels.\\n\\n**24h Chart (4-hour candles):**\\nThe 8-day lookback shows more significant structure. The reference low (84,432.2) occurred 13 candles back (~2 days ago). Since that low, the market has recovered somewhat but recently made a devastating decline with the last candle showing a large red close near 84,500. However, at the 24h horizon, the market has more time and distance. The recent price action is very near the reference low (~1% above), but within 24 hours, mean reversion patterns and support structures could provide some lift.

Short-term, the structure suggests mild support holding.\\n\\n**1h chart (15-min candles):** Reference low 84432.2 is 30 candles back (~7.5 hours). Current price ~85100. There's a clear downtrend from ~89000 to current levels, but the price has shown some bounce/consolidation in recent bars around 85000-85200.

The recent stabilization above 84,500 and lower Bollinger Band support suggest the reference low at 84,432.2 will hold in the next 15 minutes. Volume is declining, typical of consolidation rather than breakdown.\\n\\n1h: The 8-hour view shows price action stabilizing after the sharp decline. Price is holding above the lower Bollinger Band and showing signs of consolidation around 85,000. However, momentum remains weak with price below both SMAs and EMAs, creating moderate risk of retesting the low.\\n\\n4h: The 1-hour candles show a significant bearish pattern - a major red candle with heavy selling pressure just formed, breaking down from consolidation. Price is at 84,450, very close to the reference low of 84,432.2. The momentum is clearly bearish, and the proximity to the reference low with continued selling pressure suggests a high probability of undercutting it within 4 hours.\\n\\n24h: The 8-day view shows Bitcoin in a clear downtrend after failing at highs near 108,000. The recent massive red candle from ~89,000 to ~84,500 demonstrates strong selling pressure. Price structure shows lower highs and the market is breaking support levels. Given the broader bearish context and strong downside momentum, the reference low is likely to be tested and broken within 24 hours.\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.72},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.65},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":false,\"confidence\":0.68},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":false,\"confidence\":0.75}}}",
