On short timeframes (15m, 1h), the presence of long lower wicks (responsive buying) and oversold conditions on momentum oscillators suggests the immediate low is secure and consolidation is likely. For the 4h and 24h horizons, the reference low of 85,296 represents a critical structural 'higher low' within the broader uptrend. Although the sharp rejection from 89k is bearish, market structure typically defends the first retest of major support levels, making a breakdown below 85,296 less probable than a consolidation or bounce in the short term.\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.95},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.85},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.75},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.6}}}",

The **RSI (not shown but inferred from volume spikes) is likely oversold**, and volume exhaustion is visible. The **Bollinger Band (BB) squeeze** (narrowing bands) suggests impending volatility breakout, but the **EMA(20) is flattening**, indicating potential support. The **volume profile** shows a **base formation**, with recent candles failing to break below the **85420.01** level.\\n   - **1h Chart:** The **double bottom pattern** near **85420.01** is forming, with **increasing volume on the bounce**. The **20 EMA is acting as support**, and the **VWAP is slightly above the current price**, reinforcing bullish sentiment. The **RSI divergence** (price lower, RSI higher) hints at exhaustion. **No clear break below the reference low** is visible.\\n\\n2. **Medium-Term (4h):**\\n   - The **reference low of 85296.835** is being respected as a **structural support level**, with **two failed attempts to break below it**. The **4h chart shows a **descending triangle breakout attempt**, but price is **consolidating above the triangle support**. The **20 EMA is rising**, and the **volume profile** indicates **accumulation at lower levels**. The **Bollinger Bands are expanding**, suggesting a potential upward breakout.\\n\\n3. **Long-Term (24h):**\\n   - The **85296.835** level aligns with the **8-day lookback**, and price is **hovering near this zone without breaking below**. The **4h candles show a **higher-low formation**, indicating **bullish momentum**. The **volume distribution** is **skewed toward the upside**, and the **EMA(20) is trending upward**, reinforcing the bullish case. **No macroeconomic catalysts** (e.g., Fed policy shifts) are visible to invalidate this.\\n\\n**Confidence Drivers:**\\n   - **Short-term (15m/1h):** Volume exhaustion, bullish engulfing, RSI divergence, and **no clear break below reference lows**.\\n   - **Medium-term (4h):** Descending triangle breakout attempt failure, **accumulation volume**, and **rising EMAs**.\\n   - **Long-term (24h):** Higher-low formation, **bullish volume skew**, and **structural support alignment**.\\n\\n**Potential Risks:**\\n   - **Short-term whipsaws** due to crypto volatility (e.g., sudden liquidation cascades).\\n   - **False breakouts** if institutional selling pressure emerges (e.g., futures/derivatives unwinds).\\n   - **Macro uncertainty** (e.g., unexpected Fed policy shifts, though none are visible at this time).\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.9},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.95},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.85},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.8}}}",

Recent 5m candles show consolidation with small wicks, and the recent bounce structure suggests short-term support is holding. Moderate confidence.\\n\\n1h horizon: The 15m chart shows price recovered from the 85,420 low 28 candles ago and has built a base around 86-87k. Price is trading near EMA(20) 87,289 with some resistance overhead, but the structure shows higher lows forming. The reference low appears secure for the next hour, though momentum is still fragile.\\n\\n4h horizon: The 1h chart shows reference low at 85,296.835 (9 candles back). Price rallied to 90k+ before recent rejection, now at 86,364. The consolidation pattern and Bollinger Band position suggest a ranging market rather than breakdown. However, the recent rejection from 90k and declining momentum present some downside risk, though not likely to retest the low within 4h.\\n\\n24h horizon: The 4h chart shows reference low 85,296.835 just 6 candles back (24h ago).

On the 4h and 24h charts, the recent deep wick and strong bounce suggest a possible exhaustion of sellers, but the pattern is not fully confirmed as a bottom, though broad support and volume have appeared below the reference lows. The risk of a further flush is decreasing but not erased, particularly on short timeframes which remain vulnerable to volatility.\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.65},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.7},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.8},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.8}}}",

This suggests a strong probability of holding the reference low in the next hour. Confidence is high due to the alignment of multiple technical indicators and volume confirmation.\\n\\n**4h Analysis:** The 1-hour chart (4h horizon) shows a more mixed but ultimately bullish structure. The price has recently broken above a downward sloping trendline, and the recent candle is a bullish engulfing pattern. However, the Bollinger Bands are wider, indicating higher volatility. The reference low here is 85296.835, and the price is currently consolidating above it. The volume profile shows a recent increase in buying pressure, which supports the potential for holding the reference low. Confidence is moderate to high, as the trendline break and bullish engulfing pattern are strong bullish signals, but the volatility adds some uncertainty.\\n\\n**24h Analysis:** The 4-hour chart (24h horizon) shows a more extended consolidation around the reference low of 85296.835. The price has been oscillating within a range and has not yet decisively broken below this level. The Bollinger Bands are relatively wide, indicating higher volatility, but the price action has been contained above the reference low for several candles. The absence of a clear downward breakout and the presence of bullish candles in recent sessions suggest a higher probability of holding the reference low over the next 24 hours. Confidence is moderate due to the extended consolidation and higher volatility, but the lack of a clear downward breakout supports the prediction.\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.95},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.9},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.85},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.75}}}",

On the 5m chart, price has been consolidating around 85000-86000 after a sharp decline, currently near 84450. The 15m and 1h charts show a clear downtrend with price well below all moving averages (SMA, EMA, VWAP). The 4h chart shows a significant red candle in the most recent period dropping from ~88500 to ~84500. Short-term (15m, 1h): Price is very close to the reference low but appears to be finding some support at this level with decreasing selling pressure visible in the volume. Medium-term (4h): The sharp sell-off may attract some buying, but the trend remains bearish. Long-term (24h): Given the strong bearish momentum across all timeframes, price below all key MAs, and the distance from VWAP (~87000), there's elevated risk of testing and potentially breaking below the reference low within 24 hours.\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.75},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.7},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.65},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":false,\"confidence\":0.55}}}",

The price has bounced somewhat from lows but remains under pressure. Recent bars show volatility with mixed momentum. No clear reversal structure yet. The prediction horizon is only 15 minutes - a very tight window. Given price is currently above the low and 15min timeframe volatility, there's elevated risk of testing lower levels. Confidence: moderate. Slight lean toward testing the low.\\n\\n**1h Chart (15-min candles, 8h lookback):**\\nPrice action shows a significant downtrend from ~89000 down to current levels. The 15m chart shows a lower low was made around 84000-84500 range roughly 1-2 hours back. Current consolidation around 85000-86000 with resistance overhead. Volume showing mixed signals - some bars with decent volume, but no strong reversal conviction. The 1h horizon means 4 more 15m candles. Given the downtrend structure is intact and only modest bounce visible, probability of testing or breaking below 84432 is elevated. However, momentum shows some stabilization. Confidence: moderate-high for new low.\\n\\n**4h Chart (1h candles, 33h lookback):**\\nThis shows a clearer picture: strong downtrend from ~90000 to current ~84450 area. The reference low 84432.2 was 32 candles (32 hours) ago - this represents a major structure point. Current price is stabilizing near that low but hasn't decisively broken above resistance. Volume profile shows distribution across the range. The 4h prediction horizon means 4 more hourly candles. The fact that price is already near the reference low and showing mixed momentum suggests limited downside from this point. The structure suggests some base-building. Lean toward holding above 84432.\\n\\n**24h Chart (4h candles, 8 days lookback):**\\nMost revealing timeframe. Clear downtrend from ~90500 down to ~84500.

This is classic double-bottom setup. Current price consolidating in 84500-88500 range. The 24h prediction horizon is significant - 6 more 4h candles. Volume on the bounce bars is moderate.

    "modelOutputRaw": "{\"reasoning\":\"ANALYSIS OF BTC/USD STRUCTURAL BOTTOM (Reference Low: 84432.2)\\n\\n**15m Chart (5-min candles, 2h lookback):**\\nCurrent price ~84939. Reference low at 84432.2 is ~507 points below current price. Looking at the 5m chart, I see recent candles ranging 85000-86500 with a downtrend into the reference low zone. The price has bounced somewhat from lows but remains under pressure. Recent bars show volatility with mixed momentum. No clear reversal structure yet. The prediction horizon is only 15 minutes - a very tight window. Given price is currently above the low and 15min timeframe volatility, there's elevated risk of testing lower levels. Confidence: moderate. Slight lean toward testing the low.\\n\\n**1h Chart (15-min candles, 8h lookback):**\\nPrice action shows a significant downtrend from ~89000 down to current levels. The 15m chart shows a lower low was made around 84000-84500 range roughly 1-2 hours back. Current consolidation around 85000-86000 with resistance overhead. Volume showing mixed signals - some bars with decent volume, but no strong reversal conviction. The 1h horizon means 4 more 15m candles. Given the downtrend structure is intact and only modest bounce visible, probability of testing or breaking below 84432 is elevated. However, momentum shows some stabilization. Confidence: moderate-high for new low.\\n\\n**4h Chart (1h candles, 33h lookback):**\\nThis shows a clearer picture: strong downtrend from ~90000 to current ~84450 area. The reference low 84432.2 was 32 candles (32 hours) ago - this represents a major structure point. Current price is stabilizing near that low but hasn't decisively broken above resistance. Volume profile shows distribution across the range. The 4h prediction horizon means 4 more hourly candles. The fact that price is already near the reference low and showing mixed momentum suggests limited downside from this point. The structure suggests some base-building. Lean toward holding above 84432.\\n\\n**24h Chart (4h candles, 8 days lookback):**\\nMost revealing timeframe. Clear downtrend from ~90500 down to ~84500. Reference low 84432.2 was 13 candles back (~52 hours ago). The most recent candles show a bounce structure - a red candle rejection low, then green candle recovery. This is classic double-bottom setup. Current price consolidating in 84500-88500 range. The 24h prediction horizon is significant - 6 more 4h candles. Volume on the bounce bars is moderate. This suggests structural support is holding. Downtrend may be exhausting.\\n\\n**Multi-timeframe synthesis:**\\n- 15m/1h: More risk of new low due to tight timeframes and ongoing downtrend momentum\\n- 4h/24h: More supportive structure with signs of reversal (double bottom setup on 24h, price stabilization)\\n- Key insight: The longer timeframes show better structural support forming, while shorter timeframes still show momentum extension risk\\n\\n**Applying learnings:**\\n- \\\"Oversold ≠ Bottom\\\": RSI/momentum may be extreme, but we need trend-line break confirmation\\n- \\\"Multi-timeframe confirmation\\\": The 24h double-bottom + 4h stabilization + 15m/1h still trending lower = conflicted signal\\n- Most reliable pattern: The 24h chart showing 2 bounces near 84432 level suggests this is forming structural support\\n- False signal risk: The downtrend is still structurally intact on shorter timeframes\\n\\n**Predictions:**\\n- **15m**: noNewLow=FALSE (60% confidence) - tight window, momentum still down, likely to tag or slightly break low\\n- **1h**: noNewLow=FALSE (62% confidence) - extended window but downtrend momentum should continue testing\\n- **4h**: noNewLow=TRUE (68% confidence) - price already at the low, stabilization visible, 4h structure improving\\n- **24h**: noNewLow=TRUE (72% confidence) - clearest double-bottom setup, bounce bars showing, longer timeframe structure supports hold\",\"predictions\":{\"15m\":{\"noNewLow\":false,\"confidence\":0.6},\"1h\":{\"noNewLow\":false,\"confidence\":0.62},\"4h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.68},\"24h\":{\"noNewLow\":true,\"confidence\":0.72}}}",
